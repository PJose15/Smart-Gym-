# State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-06-03)

**Core value:** Members get instantly-personalized, AI-progressed workouts at the machine; gyms get the operating system that turns equipment usage into retention.
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.0 — Tier 1 Launch Blockers, roadmap created, planning Phase 1

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 — Gym Owner Self-Serve Onboarding (not started)
Plan: —
Status: Roadmap created; Phase 2 (Mobile Social Feed) already delivered 2026-07-17
Progress: [░█░░░░] 1/6 phases complete (Phase 2)
Last activity: 2026-07-19 — REQUIREMENTS.md + ROADMAP.md created (30 requirements, 6 phases, 100% coverage); Phase 2 marked complete retroactively
Next action: `/gsd:plan-phase 1` — plan Owner Onboarding in full executable detail (user priority)

## Accumulated Context

- First GSD-tracked milestone. Pre-GSD codebase imported via Validated requirements in PROJECT.md, sourced from `NEXERA_FULL_CODEBASE_AUDIT.md`.
- 6 phases for v1.0 (see ROADMAP.md):
  1. Gym Owner Self-Serve Onboarding (PLAN FIRST)
  2. Mobile Social Feed — ✅ COMPLETE 2026-07-17 (commits `cba42c0` + `af69753`, delivered pre-roadmap)
  3. Mobile Challenges
  4. Mobile Program View
  5. UptimizeAI Agent Connection (13 automations)
  6. Notification Orchestration Wiring
- User priority: Plan Phase 1 (Owner Onboarding) in full executable detail first.
- Backend already exists for mobile phases (gym_challenges tables, member_program_assignments) — Phases 3-4 are primarily UI work.
- Most novel build is Phase 1 (Stripe-heavy, new auth+billing flow, CSV import). New deps needed: `react-hook-form`, `@hookform/resolvers`, `csv-parse`.
- **Database clean:** migrations 001-026. The "4 ghost tables" note in PROJECT.md Context is resolved (DOC_02 reconciliation via migrations 024-026; client grants restored).
- **Demo environment exists:** Iron Society, 50 members, deterministic UUIDs — `supabase/seed-bulk.sql` + `DEMO_SETUP.md`. Use for phase verification.
- **Design system (DOC_03) fully implemented:** brand fonts, purple `#7C5CFF` token palette, celebration components, skeletons. All new UI must use these tokens/components.
- **Test baseline:** 803 tests (399 ai-assist + 269 web-admin + 135 mobile). CI (ESLint + tsc + tests) must stay green.
- **Phase 5 ↔ 6 ordering tension:** agents (Phase 5) output pushes delivered by the Phase 6 dispatcher. Resolve in Phase 5 planning: build minimal dispatcher (NOTIF-01 core) as Phase 5's first plan, OR scope Phase 5 outputs to owner email + logs until Phase 6. Loop-safety dedup (AGENT-02) must precede any agent wiring.
- Key Phase 1 pitfalls (see research/PITFALLS.md): Stripe webhook idempotency (`stripe_events_processed` table first), atomic gym creation via RPC, RLS session refresh after signup, CSV BOM handling, validate-then-import.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-07-19 — created REQUIREMENTS.md (30 REQ-IDs, 6 categories) + ROADMAP.md (6 phases, Phase 2 complete), updated this file.
Resume with: `/gsd:plan-phase 1`
